# Database MySQL foundation course - Final Project

## School Admin system, using Hibernate against a MySQL database

This was our final assignment for our MySQL database course. In this assignment we used Hibernate and the DAO pattern to create a School Admin console application.
In this app I choose to use the newer Jakarta.ee namespace for the persistence.xml file, focusing mostly on Hibernate functionality and methods to work against the mysql database.
The program included commands for adding, removing, modifying and requesting data from an external MySQL database including data for Programs, courses, teachers and students

*Please don't judge my old newbie self too harshly. Hopefully my later projects speaks for themselves* :)
